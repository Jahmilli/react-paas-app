        <p>
        “The Professional Aeronautics and Astronautics Society was founded for you – the student of UTS.
        We believe heavily in advancing the capabilities of the human race through our innate curiosity,
        determination to challenge the status quo, and the ability to innovate technologies for our future.
        Through this, we wish to foster collaboration and teamwork between individuals regardless of their
        background. By cooperating with fellow students and industry, you can develop the systems which may get
        us to Mars, prevent droughts in third world countries or facilitate unity between opposing governments.
        The PAAS member will be a part of the next generation who will lead the Space Industry.
        The sky is not the limit.”
